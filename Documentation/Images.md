# Images [​](#images)

Images are found in Wikimedia projects as standalone contributions and as supplementary content to engage and communicate with individuals.

## Image selection [​](#image-selection)

We use images to help increase understanding and engagement with individuals. When using images in our projects, the selections follow general guidelines:

*   **Contextually relevant.** Images relate directly to the subject of the article. An article about bicycles should contain images that relate to, support, and enrich content about bicycles.
*   **Neutral point of view.** When showing an image of a shark, consider a side profile photograph of a shark instead of an action shot of a shark preying on another animal.
*   **Representation in the most accurate medium.** Use a photograph of Rosalind Franklin in her biographic profile, rather than an artistic drawing. In an article about Donald Duck, use a cartoon still of Donald Duck instead of a photograph of a duck.
*   **Good resolution quality.** Images should be high quality.
*   **Respects copyright.** Images should be correctly attributed. Use Creative Commons, Fair use, or Public Domain images stored on Wikimedia Commons, and other sources that comply correctly with copyright licensing.
