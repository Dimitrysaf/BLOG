# Icons [​](#icons)

Icons help convey a message visually.

![Examples of Codex icons.](/codex/main/assets/01_icons-sample.Da_upXE4.png)

## Principles [​](#principles)

Wikimedia icons should be simple and neutral.[\[1\]](#ref1)

### Reduce to the essential form [​](#reduce-to-the-essential-form)

Use fewer details to convey the icon in as simple a shape as possible. The core idea of the design should be clearly conveyed and should remain discernible even at smaller sizes. For example, a keyboard should not be represented by showing all 100+ keys that are in the real object, since this would make it unrecognizable.

### Universal rather than culturally-specific [​](#universal-rather-than-culturally-specific)

Symbols and ideas represented in iconography should be known to a global audience. For example, do not use a dollar sign “$” to represent money, or a four-leaf clover to represent luck.

### Avoid textual content within the icon [​](#avoid-textual-content-within-the-icon)

Besides loss of universal recognition when including a specific language element, it may add unnecessary complexity. There are exceptions for icons related to language/text (for example, the icon for language switching).

### Abstract forms or concrete objects [​](#abstract-forms-or-concrete-objects)

Take consideration when deciding to use abstract or concrete objects when designing an icon. In some cases, concrete objects are preferred, such as using dice to convey “random” or a bell to convey an alert. In other cases, abstract symbols may be preferable, such as using an question mark “?” for help rather than a life preserver, or an ellipsis “…” to indicate “more”.

### Neutral point of view [​](#neutral-point-of-view)

Avoid concepts such as gestures, animals, religion, humor, ethnicity, and gender.

## Usage [​](#usage)

### Icon size [​](#icon-size)

Icons can be used inside other components, like buttons. Icons support a few different pre-defined size options. Right now the supported sizes are: 20px, 16px or 12px. If no size property is provided, 20px size will be used by default.

### Adapt and remix [​](#adapt-and-remix)

Our icons are freely licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The simple style and guidelines make it easy to reuse or adapt existing freely licensed icons that you can find on other repos such as [Material icons](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html)[\[3\]](#ref3) or the [Noun project](https://thenounproject.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200509798-What-licenses-do-you-use-)[\[4\]](#ref4). You are welcome to use existing icons that align to the proposed style instead of reinventing the wheel icon.

## Visual style [​](#visual-style)

![Dimensions of Codex icons.](/codex/main/assets/02_visual-style.B2Oxgzy-.png)

Characteristics of a Codex icon:

*   **Monochromatic**. Solid color icons.
*   **Geometric**. Comprises simple and symmetrical geometric shapes. Symmetrical icons tend to be more universally applicable. For example, an open book would be preferred to a closed book with binding on the left or right side).
*   **Front-facing**. Icons are flat and front facing, not multi-dimensional.
*   **20 x 20 dp default canvas**. WikimediaUI icons are put on a 20 x 20 device-independent pixel (dp) canvas per default.[\[2\]](#ref2)
*   **Rounded corners**. Corners are rounded to make shapes friendly and welcoming. For the default canvas use 2 dp rounded corners. Note that rounded corners are applied only on the exterior of an icon shape, not interior corners.
*   **Medium thick stroke**. Lines and outline should be visible at smaller sizes without effort, for the default icon canvas use a 2 dp thick stroke as standard. Endpoints of lines are square in keeping with simple geometric shapes.
*   **Diagonal cross-out lines**. For icons that appear to be crossed-out, the cross-out line starts from the top-left of the icon and continues at a 45 degree angle to the bottom right (similar to a backslash “\\”).

## Creating icons [​](#creating-icons)

The default canvas is 20 x 20 dp. In order to allow for optical adjustments, a different margin is applied depending on the shape of the icon.

![Visualization of the canvas for Codex icons with different margins for different shapes.](/codex/main/assets/03_creating-icons.JAdwQ0pp.png)

Different shapes have different perceived sizes. A 1 dp margin for a square-shaped icon is used. A circle uses the full 20 x 20 dp canvas available to reach a similar perceived size.

**Black icons:** Use black colored icons on a transparent background, as the boldest representation of an icon. The color can be changed when the icon is used (preferably done automatically by software).

**Filled areas with no stroke outlines:** For example, a donut icon is a filled circle with a hole in the middle, as opposed to an unfilled circle with a thick stroke outline.

**Pixel-fitting:** Ensure icon shape edges are fit to pixels as closely as possible, so that shapes are not distorted or fuzzy.

**Right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) considerations:** In cases where the icon is non-symmetrical, consider whether RTL or LTR directionality changes the meaning conveyed before creating the alternate direction variation. For example, the play button is universally seen as a triangle with a straight left edge and does not require two variations, whilst a bullet list icon would show the “bullets” in the list on the right or left side depending on whether it is shown in RTL or LTR language context.
